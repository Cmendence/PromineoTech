/*Movie Rating

Determine if the movie rating is good(a rating of 7 or above is considered good)
Determine if the movie rating is great(a rating of 8 or above is considered great)

/*Shopping Spree:

Let's go on a shopping spree! We can buy all the items we want if we have enough money and all the stores are open. Use the already declared variables money, itemCost and storeOpen. Determine if we can buy all the items, and print the result to the console using console.log().

The parameters are in this order(itemCost, money, storeOpen).
Using console.log() and boolean operators, determine if money is greater than or equal to the cost of all the items and if storeOpen is true.

The greater than or equal to operator is >=.
The and operator is &&. */

const itemCost = 50;
const storeOpen = true;



/***
 * Is it Lunchtime?

Is it time for lunch? If the time is between 12 PM and 1 PM, print true. Otherwise, print false.

The values should be of type boolean, not strings.
The comparison operator we want to use is >= and <=.
The AND operator is &&.

var isLunchTime = time > = 12 && time <= 13;

/***
 * Bonus Question:
* 
*  Is it a sunny day? If the temperature is greater than 75 degrees AND the sky is clear, print true. Otherwise, print false.
Ã¥You will need to use the greater than > operator and the AND && operator. The temperature being greater than 75 degrees AND the sky being clear should be in parenthesis to ensure they are checked before the final output is printed.
