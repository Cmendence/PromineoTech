# Promineo Tech Week 4

This is the git repository for the class. It will be updated on a class by class basis.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PromineoTech.git
```

Add the original repository as a remote to your forked repository:

```bash
cd PromineoTech
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Louis345/PromineoTech.git
git remote -v
# You should see your upstream set as https://github.com/Louis345/PromineoTech.git
git config pull.rebase true
```

At any point, if you see the message "Please tell me who you are" in your command line output, you will need to setup your command line to use your Github account. Follow the instruction underneath where it says "Run", replacing "youremail@example.com" and "Your Name" with your information.

Finally, to run the tests for the exercises, you will need to install testing libraries:

```bash
npm install
```
